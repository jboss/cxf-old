Apache CXF 2.4.10 Release Notes

1. Overview

The 2.4.x versions of Apache CXF are significant new versions of CXF 
that provides several new features and enhancements.  

New features include: 
* Log Browser Console - see the logbrowser sample for an example
* Transformation feature provides for a fast and effective way to transform inbound 
  and/or outbound XML messages, please see the TransformationFeature page for more 
  information.
* JIBX databinding
* Faster startup and reduced spring configuration. The Spring support has been redone
  to be based on the ExtensionManagerBus. This results in much faster startup. It also
  means that all of the imports of META-INF/cxf/cxf-extension-*.xml are no longer 
  needed and are deprecated.  Additionaly, all features are now available when 
  using the ExtensionManager Bus instead of being forced to use Spring.
* WSS4J has been updated from 1.5.x to 1.6. See http://ws.apache.org/wss4j/wss4j16.html
  for the list of new features and upgrade notes for Apache WSS4J 1.6.  Some notable new 
  features for CXF users include:
    * SAML2 support: WSS4J 1.6 includes full support for creating, manipulating and 
    parsing SAML2 assertions, via the Opensaml2 library. See
    http://coheigea.blogspot.com/2011/02/support-for-saml2-assertions-in-wss4j.html 
    for more information.
    * Performance work: A general code-rewrite has been done with a focus on improving 
    performance.
    * Support for Crypto trust-stores: WSS4J 1.6 separates the concept of keystore and 
    truststores. See http://coheigea.blogspot.com/2011/01/wss4j-16-crypto-property-change.html
    for more information.
 * WS-SecurityPolicy support for SAML tokens.
 * Initial OSGi Blueprint support for JAX-WS and JAX-RS
 * A simple framework for building an STS was added to CXF's WS-Security module.   See the
   sts_issue_operation sample to see this being used to generate SAML tokens based on X509 
   certs used for the authentication.


Users are encourage to review the migration guide at:
http://cxf.apache.org/docs/24-migration-guide.html
for further information and requirements for upgrading to 2.4.0.   In particular, the upgrades 
to WSS4J and Neethi will require some migration work if you use the WSS4J API's directly or
have created your own Policy objects or builders.   Additionally, XmlSchema was update to 2.0 
so any custom Aegis types may need to be updated.


2.4.10 fixes over 20 JIRA issues reported by users and the community.
